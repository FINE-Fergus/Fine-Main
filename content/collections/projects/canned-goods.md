        text: "Canned Goods was born out of a searing passion for hospitality photography - and only that. A lover of real culinary experiences, Melbourne-based artist Monica Styles shoots for the world of restaurants and bars. The stories she tells through photography and copywriting are as authentic as it gets. No sugar-coating with over-processed, over-lit scenes to be found. Rather, her work carries honest representations of experiences and process from front of house to back of house and every cool-room and licked plate in between. She represents only a tiny collective of venues at a time, managing their social media feeds from start to finish.\_"

        text: 'From name to visual identity, everything about the Canned Goods brand confidently speaks to the mission at heart. A no-name palette, a delicately-strained balance between scale and negative space as the brandâ€™s goods are pushed around the touchpoint like items on a kitchen shelf. This leaves us with an honest portrayal of a passionate artist - one with a focused offering and a deep, deep love of food and the odd Negroni.'
