        text: 'Bags To Go have been in the travel luggage business for over 20 years, starting with a single bricks and mortar store before expanding across Australia. Following a tumultuous couple of years of business thanks to a sneaky virus, the world was ready to start travelling again and Bags To Go needed to seize the opportunity.  The challenge here was not losing touch with the heritage of the brand and the good will it holds amongst the community, whilst creating an identity and ensuing marketing approach that could also serve as springboard to catapult online sales and scale digitally.'

        text: 'With so many touch-points dotted around the country, from store signage and billboards, to TV commercials and digital assets this was a prime case of a brand in need of cohesion. We redefined the entire visual identity, bringing the right amount of minimalism to the table, whilst leaning into the nostalgia of a sales business with a particularly price-sensitive audience.'

        text: "The 'baggy' character was reinvented, restyled and brought to life through motion graphics. Adding a sense of playful dynamism, he's since been featured in giant billboards, TV and socials Australia-wide, and offers the brand a flexible tool where an injection of personality is required to garner audience attention."

        text: 'Once the brand visuals and voice were dialled in, our efforts shifted the business side of the equation. Rollout on this one included a new custom front end to a (rather gigantic) Shopify Plus store along with e-commerce strategy and implementation. This involved customer journey mapping, user behaviour analysis and painpoint identification. From here we could make informed decisions on the website design itself, honing the UX to build audience trust quickly, encourage conversions from browsing to sales, and increasing cart value at every opportunity.

        text: 'This final piece of the puzzle was the marketing itself. We went to work on the data to formulate and execute a highly analytical marketing campaign involving SEM (Google Ads), Social Ads, EDM (email marketing) and aligning all this with in-store activities too. At every stage the return on investment remained paramount in informing our decisions, harbouring feedback and refining the campaigns. '
