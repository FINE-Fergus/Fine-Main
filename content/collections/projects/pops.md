        text: "Pops love to cook. He makes heat and serve meals for clubs, pubs and restaurants - solving the skilled labour shortage one meatball at a time. He’s also a cheeky bastard who’s not afraid to tell you what he really thinks. He’s in the kitchen Monday to Friday delivering fresh to you when you’re feeling lazy. Saturday he goes fishing and Sunday is date night, so if you call him then you're digging your own grave."

        text: "We created a brand that taps firmly into the nostalgia of a decent home cooked dinner. Just because you're making meals en masse, doesn't mean you forget to add sizeable dollop of good old Italian love. The Pops identity serves as a solid reminder of this very fact."
