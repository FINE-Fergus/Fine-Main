        text: "A brand new player in the world of technology consulting, Hide and Seek are a 40-strong team of strategists, designers and developers. They don't fuck around. Their global projects are underpinned by playful curiosity yet run with ruthless efficiency. From a positioning perspective they sit beautifully in between the big four consulting agencies and the smaller boutiques. This allows them to attract large government and private clients and offer them a unique opportunity for value and efficiency in the digital projects they roll out."

        text: 'We leaned heavily into the nature of play to help Hide and Seek create an identity around their name that would reflect their positioning and refreshing attitude. Clients accustomed to more corporate interactions are instantly presented with a new lens on how their engagements can now look and feel, whilst still respecting the need to build trust with the audience given the scale of projects at stake.'
