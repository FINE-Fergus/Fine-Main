Days are back-breakingly long, the mud and sweat are as real as it gets, and you’re generally seen as the lowest form of life when it comes to construction site hierarchy. And therein lies the challenge - how do you craft an identity for a company that does truly shitty work? '

        text: 'Enter Dirty. There’s no sugar coating here, just frank honesty about the realities of the gig and the financial and cultural benefits if you do indeed decide to embrace the role. Sure this is manual labour at it’s worst, but the people around you are what keep you coming back for more. They’re a team that wear their lowly status proudly like a badge of honour.'

        text: 'With a name like Dirty it would have been cheeseballs to take the visual direction too literally. Instead we created the perfect paradox. A clean slate ready to be fucked with. A minimal, type-driven identity that would let the copy demand maximum attention. Intentionally abrupt, it acts as a filter for hiring tough candidates, and a refreshing breath of honesty for potential clients.'
