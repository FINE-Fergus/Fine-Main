        text: 'A mindful home in the beautiful town that is Noosa, Australia. This space was reimagined as a warm sanctuary to reinforce a lifestyle change, reflecting the calming nature of living in paradise. We wanted to capture this essence and bring it indoors, crafting a space that fosters slow living.'

        text: 'Our process was as mindful as the result we were chasing. Like all our spaces we took a strong neuro-architectural approach to the design, focusing on developing a visual language that would bathe the senses. Every texture, colour and finish was carefully curated to imbue this. '

        text: 'A top to bottom redesign, every element of James St was fully reworked back to bare studs. Custom timber work brings the nature indoors, whilst the palette is both calming and tonal. Distraction and visual noise are kept to a minimum at all times.'

        text: 'Light management was also a key area of focus, with exacting choices made across every space to allow precise control of light - both natural and artificial. Window textiles chosen are both textural and tonal, keeping a sense of warmth at all times. They were given specific transparency levels depending on their zone and orientation. Beyond the obvious benefits to privacy afforded by these choices, this is also key to ensuring control of melatonin levels, promoting healthy sleep-wake cycles and reducing stress. '

        text: 'Likewise, sound management at James St was another clear design consideration. Material choices, joinery design and appliance locations were all highly considered, providing a space where living is always undisturbed. Similarly, automation technologies were deployed wherever possible, with lighting, garden watering, and music all controlled via an app, or voice activation. '
