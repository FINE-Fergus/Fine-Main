        text: "Insight do social media. They run accounts, ads and exist at the forefront of what's ticking on social. It had been 10 years since they started their company and they were in need of a brand and website that reflected their established position in the market, the kudos they'd accumulated, and showed off their growing portfolio of clients."

        text: 'Creative services and performance marketing operate at two differing ends of the spectrum. One is a fun, experimental expression, peacocking for attention in the world of scroll, the other is a cold-blooded calculation that needs to remain ruthless and logic-drive to drive success. We crafted a visual narrative that tactically highlights the the interplay between these two domains. Leaning heavily into the visual language of the web, we embedded this directly into the brand. Net result - a visual identity that builds trust and shows off capability at every opportunity. '

        text: "The website itself is Insight's core touchpoint, acting as a lead convertor. In a fully custom build, we placed a strong UX lens over this one, focusing on conversions as much as storytelling. Subtle behavioural nudges are woven throughout the entire sitemap whilst the animations and copywriting bring attitude aplenty. Have fun exploring this one."
