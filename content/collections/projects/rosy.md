        text: 'The last two years have been a bit of a reality check for many of us. Globally, our mental health status took a low blow. Depression and anxiety levels went through the roof, prescriptions came along for the ride. Enter Rosy. A telehealth startup on a mission to reimagine our mental health landscape. They needed a name and a visual identity to authentically represent their telehealth psychology platform.'

        text: 'Human connection is paramount with psychology services, especially when you add in a layer of technology through a telehealth connection. Getting the right client talking to the right therapist is the most important problem that Rosy solves. Likewise, stigma was also high up on the hitlist. The brand had to bust away any friction caused by social reservations around the modality. This is a service that can help people change their lives for the better and our brand had to help unlock this potential.'

        text: 'In a market full of “it’s okay to not be okay” messaging, Rosy needed to stand alone with a refreshingly frank lens on the issue - one that would normalise, intrigue and excite people about the fresh experience that awaits. The brand intentionally walks a fine line - approachability and friendliness took the front seats but we still had to fit a hint of professionalism in the back of the car too. A name suggestive of the outcome, a smiling wordmark, a bold tagline, down-to-earth copy throughout and a brave social campaign land Rosy away from the stereotypes of old worldly psychology practices and firmly in the era of tech-savvy startups with something genuinely good to offer the world.'
